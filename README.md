# Nevada Impact Discord Bot
This repository contains the source code and files for the Nevada Impact Discord Bot, which I built with Javascript, NodeJS, and MongoDB Atlas. This bot was created for my streaming audience and Genshin Impact game enthusiasts. The bot offers features that help other players traverse the game more easily, such as instructions and crucial information, as well as maintaining member data such as level, status, and rank. The data is kept in a Mongo dB Atlas database, which acts as the project's backend. You may join my Discord server by clicking here: https://lnkd.in/dDv5QtvM.

The bot has several characteristics that can improve community members' involvement and participation. Among these characteristics are:

- Sharing information about the Genshin Impact game, such as characters, weaponry, and events.
- Accepting and displaying donations from fans on stream - Sharing links to my streaming channel, social media profiles, website, and other platforms
- Managing server settings like roles, permissions, channels, and so on.
